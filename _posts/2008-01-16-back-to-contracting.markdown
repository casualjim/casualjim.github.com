Yesterday I gave notice at [Xero](http://www.xero.com), my last day will be mid February (15/02).

It's been fun working with the team of people at Xero, but I just want my own time back. I won't go into more detail around the reasons for my leaving Xero but we part ways on friendly terms.

I've been getting more and more into Ruby again and I really like that language. So I'm mostly interested in jobs that will allow me to use those dynamic languages. I can now take some time off to finish the book I'm writing and to do some coding on a couple of things I have in mind.

Ideal places for me to work would be a place that practices Agile development et al. I'll be going back to contracting probably unless somebody makes me a really great offer :)
