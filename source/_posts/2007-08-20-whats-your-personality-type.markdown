Through John Clegg I found out about a personality test on bbc.co.uk.

He has a more lengthy explanation on how he got there on [his blog](http://blog.projectxtech.com/2007/08/20/whats-your-personality-type/)

Anyway I'm always interested in finding out which type of person I am etc. So I could not resist and took the test.  
If you're like me and just itching to find out more about yourself or you just have some time to spare you can take the test here [http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/surveys/whatamilike/](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/surveys/whatamilike/)

Apparently I'm a _**Big Thinker**_ 

The four aspects that make up this personality type are:

![Spontaneous, Ideas, Heads and Extrovert](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/images/mind/whatamilike/types/big_thinker.gif)  

### Summary of Big-Thinkers

  * Outspoken, ingenious and bored by routine  
  * Think of themselves as talkative, curious and self-sufficient  
  * May neglect the routine work required to make their plans successful 

### More about Big-Thinkers

Big Thinkers are always looking for the next big idea or opportunity. They’re adept at spotting trends and thinking on their feet. Big Thinkers like to jump in and find innovative solutions to complex problems and are good at developing strategies for the future.

Big Thinkers are usually curious, logical and energetic. This chatty group enjoys a good debate and asserting their opinions. Sometimes others may find the way they express their ideas too abrupt or challenging.

In situations where they can't use their talents or are unappreciated, Big Thinkers may be rude, critical of others or rebellious. Under extreme stress, Big Thinkers can become preoccupied with unimportant details and lose sight of the 'big picture'.

Big Thinkers may ignore important details in their plans and overlook the impact their ideas have on the people around them.

### Big-Thinker Careers

The entrepreneurial spirit of the Big Thinkers often leads them to seek new challenges; this is often more important to them than working in a particular field or a specific career.

**Disclaimer:**

It's important to remember that no survey can predict personality type with 100 percent accuracy. Experts say that we should use personality type to better understand ourselves and others, but shouldn't feel restricted by our results.
