Microsoft has just hired [Rob Connery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/26/microsoft-subsonic-and-me/) from SubSonic, and his job is going to be to work on his own open source project.  

I am very pleasantly surprised by that news, and this is the change of direction so many people have been waiting for I think.   

  

I for one like this whole new direction of embracing open source. It seems like lately the party can't stop, they also hired: Scott Hanselman, Phil Haack and Alex James. I should maybe start thinking about getting one aggregated feed from msdn :)  

  

It's good to see that open source projects are now being endorsed. I can't wait to see what's next.Â
