Welcome to my blog. This is a collection of random thoughts and rants.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Ivan Porto Carrero and I'm an enthusiastic developer on .NET and Ruby.
Through this blog I hope I can share some of that passion and maybe help somebody out when they are looking on how to do something.

I'm currently writing the book IronRuby in Action for Manning and am always open for work proposals
