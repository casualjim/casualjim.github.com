Yesterday I got to meet an [Argentinian guy](http://futureneutral.blogspot.com/) who joined the [NBlogr](http://www.nblogr.com)

He showed me a couple of really cool sites that I thought would be a good idea to share.

An open-source resource oriented project management system : [Open Workbench](http://www.openworkbench.org/)

An open-source search engine (finds open source programs built on Lucence) : [Krugle](http://www.krugle.com/) 

And last but not least an article on the codeproject :

This article describes a "script engine" for the C# language. Here are some of the key features of the presented scripting system: 

  * Based on the full featured C#.  
  * Full access to CLR and CTS.  
  * Can be run with any version of CLR (.NET 1.1/2.0), even potentially with future releases.  
  * Possibility of extending the functionality of any CLR application with "scripting", by hosting the script engine in this application.  
  * Integration with common IDEs and debuggers.  
  * Integration with OS.  
  * Availability of comprehensive documentation (local and online Help, tutorials, samples...).
