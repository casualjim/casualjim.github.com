    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I moved my blog to be on <a href="http://www.webhost4life.com/default.asp?refid=casualjim">webhost4life.com</a></p>

<p>I'm also changing blogging engines and announcing that I will stop  development on nblogr.</p>

<p>NBlogr was almost ready for a v1 release but it has  too big of a memory footprint. The footprint is 70MB which is too much for a  blog.</p>

<p>To fix this I would have to change my data access layer to a different  approach.Â  I decided instead to switch to subtext and I'll see which features I  can provide from nblogr for subtext as plugins. I also don't have the time  anymore to occupy myself with nblogr.</p>

<p>The feed should remain working without  a change. I upgraded my blog to subtext using <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/02/03/From-DasBlog-To-SubText.aspx">Ayende's  instructions</a></p>

<p>Which means that the permalinks should still work but urls  that contain a guid won't work anymore.</p>

<p>The reason for moving from dasblog to  subtext are the same as why i started nblogr in the first place. Dasblog has  been nothing but a hassle for me. It is often down, does only trackbacks to my  own domain, and many more annoyances.</p>
