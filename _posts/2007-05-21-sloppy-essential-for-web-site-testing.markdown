We had a lunch with Sam from [TradeMe](http://www.trademe.co.nz/) todayÂ from which I took that most of the people are surfing at dial up speeds in NZ. First off : I can't believe you would settle for that :)

This poses a problem because on my pc or connection I have got full speed so all my javascript etc initializes fast. Sam went on in his talk only briefly mentioning Sloppy a tool that will simulate other bandwith speeds on your machine
