The built in webserver from Visual Studio 2005 is great for locally quickviewing asp.net websites.  
I always thought it was a pitty that I had to start visual studio for it.




Today I came accross a blog of a guy who wrote a small shell extension so you can right-click any folder and choose run asp.net 2.0 website from the context menu. It will run the webserver on that folder. How easy do you want it ?
