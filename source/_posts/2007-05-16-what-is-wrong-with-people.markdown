Did I miss the memo about having to be religious about the tools you use. In my mind anything that falls in the category religion should be banned as it is a cancer on society. Philosophy is good. Budhism is a philosophy to which I would subscribe for example. I am allergic to people that tell me what to think, probably why I never really fell for the "ruby community". I don't need convincing, I'll do that myself, I just want correct information and plenty of it. 

That being said I stumbled across this thread where people are actively discouraging [Miguel de Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/) to implement silverlight and co in Mono

These are the reactions to it on channel 9.

I personally use both I use Linux and I use vista both on a 64 bit system.  I like the whole simplicity of linux but the applications for it are not nearly as finished as the ones that are there on the windows platform.

For example MonoDevelop doesn't come anywhere near Visual studio. Gimp is no photoshop, ....

Microsoft provides a more viable eco system for people to make money of what they do. I do wish Microsoft would support open source a bit more instead of copying it and thus mostly killing the OSS project. Although I do understand that they are a **business **

If I would have more time I'd certainly want to contribute to Mono but unfortunately there are only so many hours in a day and these hours are not enough.

To get back to my original point. You can be passionate about something, and everybody that has spent some time talking to me will have picked up on the fact that I don't just accept the technologies that are being shoved down our throats these days.

The reason I don't read blogs on Ruby anymore is the following: I simply couldn't stomach the people going on and on about how cool their mac is and yet they need to reboot it on a regular basis. My vista pc at work hasn't rebooted for the last 2 weeks now, before that I got a BSOD regarding memory management :)  
Furthermore there are programmers that keep going on about the fact that notepad/vi/emacs/textmate/eclipse are the best tools for developing applications.  
I don't know about you but for me programming is about creating stuff, preferrably fast and visual studio is the perfect fit for it.

Granted my vista pc doesn't look nearly as cool as a mac or an ubuntu with berryl machine but I am far more productive for my job on it.

So my conclusion for this post would be :   
Don't get religious about your tools/language/platform but choose the best one for the job at hand.

Uhm.. this post turned out to be a big rant instead of my intended post which was going to be about how much I look forward to C# 3.0 and the DLR.

As soon as I can get my hands on some of the bits I'll be posting my findings.
