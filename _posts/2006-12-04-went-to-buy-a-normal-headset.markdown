I couldn't really say goodbye to vista. So I thought the cheaper option would be to go buy a wired headset in anticipation of the bluetooth headset drivers.

I am dissapointed that they worked in RC1/RC2 but not in the RTM release.

I can find some comfort in the matter that I'm not the only one that has these problems.
