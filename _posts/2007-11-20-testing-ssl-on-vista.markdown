Today I had the requirement to add SSL encryption to some of the pages in one of my projects.

 

To test this I remembered that IIS6 had a tool SelfSSL and tried to use that.. failing my first attempt I also saw a folder OpenSSL in my tools folder. At which point i turned to google and google came up with this [link to Scott Gu's blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/04/06/tip-trick-enabling-ssl-on-iis7-using-self-signed-certificates.aspx). I'm stoked about the fact that IIS7 has this ability built into it. Following the steps he outlines there helped me get going really quickly.

 

ThanksÂ  Scott :)
