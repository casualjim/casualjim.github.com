Peter has a post giving an overview of some tools that are essential to him as a developer.




[http://jonesie.net.nz/EssentialTools.aspx](http://jonesie.net.nz/EssentialTools.aspx)




I would say that I use most of them but not all and I would like to add a few to the list because i mainly do webdevelopment and that's a different story then winforms.  
Obviously I made the choice to go for atlas so I won't sum up any other ajax frameworks. That is reserved for a separate post. 




AJAX/Web development:




Internet Explorer :   
[Fiddler](http://www.fiddlertool.com/Fiddler/version.asp) - a tool to view http traffic (that gets sent through IE)  
[WebdevelopmentHelper BHO ](http://www.nikhilk.net/Project.WebDevHelper.aspx)- A tool written by Nikhil Kothari and I consider it crucial  
[Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&displaylang=en) - This has got a lot of cool things you do want to know about your page sometimes.




Mozilla/firefox :   
[Greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/) - makes firefox highly extensible.  
[WebDeveloper toolbar](http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/) - This has got a lot of cool things you do want to know about your page sometimes.  
[Venkman Javascript Debugger](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/) - Javascript debugging is a must :)  
[Greasemonkey Http Trace script](http://blog.monstuff.com/archives/000291.html) - does the same as the BHO or fiddler for IE.




Collaborative development:  
We are mostly using team foundation server to do continuous integration. However sometimes when a lot of different parties are involved we can't use the team foundation testing suite and then we use other tools to do our integration.




[TestDriven.NET](http://www.testdriven.net/default.aspx) - does nunit testing and code coverage in VS 2005 - this used to be free but it isn't anymore.  
[CruiseControl.NET](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET) - does the builds based on nAnt or msbuild build scripts etc. It's the continous integration server alternative that we use  
[GhostDoc](http://www.roland-weigelt.de/ghostdoc/) - essential for documenting your code.
