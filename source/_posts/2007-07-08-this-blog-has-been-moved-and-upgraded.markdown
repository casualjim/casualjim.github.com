I moved my blog to be on [webhost4life.com](http://www.webhost4life.com/default.asp?refid=casualjim)




I'm also changing blogging engines and announcing that I will stop  development on nblogr.  

NBlogr was almost ready for a v1 release but it has  too big of a memory footprint. The footprint is 70MB which is too much for a  blog.  

To fix this I would have to change my data access layer to a different  approach.Â  I decided instead to switch to subtext and I'll see which features I  can provide from nblogr for subtext as plugins. I also don't have the time  anymore to occupy myself with nblogr.  

The feed should remain working without  a change. I upgraded my blog to subtext using [Ayende's  instructions](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/02/03/From-DasBlog-To-SubText.aspx)  

Which means that the permalinks should still work but urls  that contain a guid won't work anymore.  

The reason for moving from dasblog to  subtext are the same as why i started nblogr in the first place. Dasblog has  been nothing but a hassle for me. It is often down, does only trackbacks to my  own domain, and many more annoyances.
