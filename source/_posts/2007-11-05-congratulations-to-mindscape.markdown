A couple of friends of mine own the company [Mindscape](http://mindscape.co.nz)

They were interviewed by [Ron Jacobs](http://blogs.msdn.com/rjacobs/) at the latest NZ tech ed in August. And that has now just been put up on channel 9 as part of the ARCast series.

The interview is about their product [LightSpeed](http://www.mindscape.co.nz/products/LightSpeed/) which IMHO is one of the nicest ORM's out there. I've used it in a couple of things now and I am absolutely surprised by the fact that lightspeed is a good name for it because it is really fast. If you haven't taken it for a test drive you should do so immediately.

Now everybody rush over there [to see their interview](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=353738).

 

Well done JB, JD and Andrew.
