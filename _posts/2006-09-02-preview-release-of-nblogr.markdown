Today I put a preview release of NBlogr online.


		

I still have to change the online site but will do so very shortly.


		

This release has very basic functionality and is not yet feature complete so a lot may change later on.


		

If anybody feels like joining the project do not hesitate :) All help I get is extremely welcome.

I'm heading into a very busy week/couple of weeks so I'm not sure if I will be able to spend as much time as I've been spending lately on the project.Â  But I think every week I will be able to show some progress at least.


		

If you feel like it go ahead and give it a try but don't upgrade your blog just yet :).


		

I'd be keen to know what your thoughts are on the subject.
