I suggest you have a read through their site because that is pretty cool.  They are currently in beta but are really friendly and helpful and welcome all new members.


		

I already know where I'll be getting "hobby" projects from because there are some interesting idea's on that site.

Tip 2: Screw the business plan. Tell them your story.  
Tip 3: Sh#t confidence.

Tip 5: Don’t marry every woman you date.  
Tip 6: Prime the pump.**
