Through [Lucy McFadden's blog](http://www.lucindigo.com) I found a bunch of slides in [this post](http://www.lucindigo.com/2007/11/13/in-the-mood-for-dinner-and-a-show/) talking about creativity and innovation.

One of my most used expressions is: **Discontent breeds innovation**

Which is my justification for being grumpy J 

Anyway Iâ€™m sure this is old news to some and will be new to others:

I particularly like slides 7, 9 , 11
