Today we got a mail from central registration service .com telling us that we need to pay 966 USD for [www.vandyck.co.nz](http://www.vandyck.co.nz)   
Now I'm very sure it's my domain name and not registered with these guys.

The company poses as a New York based company but the letter is sent from Prague.Â 

I just blog about it because it looks kind of official and maybe other people might not discard it.

When will I be able to put a spam filter on my regular mailbox ?
