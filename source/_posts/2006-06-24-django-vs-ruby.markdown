Ruby looks to me like a hack. I'm not the only one with problems there :)

> I  decided to ignore Ruby for the moment and focus on Rails. What i noted:

> 

> 
> 

>   * Very simple to install and set up new projects 

>   * You create a database and it’s tables, and Rails will handle them 

>   * Things get messy when you want to write SQL instead of using the framework to access the data model 

>   * URL generation is simple but not flexible 

>   * Rails templates looked ASPish, horrible, almost cthulhian. I couldn’t stand the sight of them. There is too much code in them and worst of all, I couldn’t find a way to change the template system (Clearsilver in Rails anyone?)
