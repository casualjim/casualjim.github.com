I just finished my session at Boot Camp. A code camp organised on the south island in Christchurch.  

  

I'd like to thank everybody for coming to listen to me, and I'd like to thank Ivan Towlson for his help on getting me started with wpf and for elaborating on the section mixins during my talk.  

  

As promised I've put my slides and demos online.

Hope to see you again soon!
