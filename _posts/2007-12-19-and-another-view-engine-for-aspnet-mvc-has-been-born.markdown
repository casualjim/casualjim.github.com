Andrew Peters wrote a [view engine for HAML](http://andrewpeters.net/2007/12/19/introducing-nhaml-an-aspnet-mvc-view-engine/)

 

NHaml (pronounced enamel) is a pure .NET implementation of the popular [Rails](http://rubyonrails.com/)[Haml](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/) view engine. From the Haml website:

 

_“Haml is a markup language that‘s used to cleanly and simply describe the XHTML of any web document, without the use of inline code. Haml functions as a replacement for inline page templating systems such as PHP, ERB, and ASP. However, Haml avoids the need for explicitly coding XHTML into the template, because it is actually an abstract description of the XHTML, with some code to generate dynamic content.”_

 

Andrew and I share the same dislike for the xml family. XML is not fun to type, and I think his haml engine eases a lot of that pain. It results in far more readable views too.

 

2 view engines in one week and both from Wellington. Nice :)
