This week I went to do a couple of presenations on atlas in the regional user groups here in New Zealand.


		

At first I was really nervous, so I apologise to the people in hamilton for not getting the best presenation I could give you, I even forgot some stuff that would make all the pieces fit together.


		

But after the first talk I started to get the hang of it, and now I regret that I can't do more talks but who knows what the future brings.


		

It was really interesting to see that there are a lot of really skilled people with a passion for programming in New Zealand.


		

 


		

So in all I would like to thank everybody for taking the time to come and listen to my ramblings on Atlas.  
And perhaps we'll meet on Teched next week.
