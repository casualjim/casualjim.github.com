One of my collegues at [Xero](http://www.xero.com) put me onto this tool [vlite](http://www.vlite.net/) which helps you build a custom ISO with only the features you need for your vista install.

Nowadays I'm running [ubuntu x64](http://www.ubuntu.com) with vmware as my base system and I have a [vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/default.mspx) running in a vmware workstation virtual machine. I'm using vmware workstation instead of server because it allows me to use dual monitors inside my virtual machine which I think is abslotely fantastic.  Thanks to [Alex Henderson](http://blog.bittercoder.com) for pointing that out to me.

My vista has got sql server 2k5 and visual studio 2008 beta 2 installed. 

So the stripped down version of vista fits on a cd instead of a dvd and is heaps faster than the regular install of vista. My vista only needs IIS I don't need all the other stuff it has got.

I hope you will find this as useful as I did when I learnt about this tool.
