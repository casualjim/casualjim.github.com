I haven't been posting much lately because I got pretty busy over the past few months and it looks like it isn't going to change quickly either.




I got added to the new zealand .NET user group with this blog. and would like to thank nic wise for adding me. his blog can be found @ [http://www.fastchicken.co.nz/blog](http://www.fastchicken.co.nz/blog)




I decided together with 2 other guys to start writing a book about quick and simple programming using .NET 2 technology. And what better way is there than to write a fully working application for this.  
The application that we will be writing will be a Forum engine à la Communityserver




The software will be developped under an open source license. I will be posting regularly articles about what I did and the controls I built. 




If somebody has a suggestion on features that are missing now in communityserver, or in other forum engines in general, now would be a good time to comment them in this post.




For the moment I am planning the rss engine.  I decided that I will just be supporting RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0  as syndicators (OPML seems to be becoming pretty popular too, so maybe I will look at OPML as well).  
The feed outputs will be kept as simple as possible (I think simple is good, the simpler it is the more programs will be able to read it even the poorly written ones.)  
  
The aggregator used should be based on AJAX and if I feel really bored someday I will build a smart client to as an extension as well.  





That's all for now..
