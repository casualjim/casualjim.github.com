Today I received my invitation to the [Lounge](http://thelounge.net) network. I just finished changing my homepage to include their ads in my side bar.      
My reasons for joining the ad network are that on one hand I’ve been an ad-sense member for a really long time and although I’ve had ads on multiple sites it never actually made me any money. Eventually I gave up on putting those ads on my blog. So I’m not really doing it to make any money of this blog, but if it takes a small bite out of my hosting bill I’ll be a happy man :).

 

The ads that are run by the lounge are .net centric and are a much better fit to the audience of this blog. It even may be helpful to somebody at times.

 

Let’s see how this works out.
