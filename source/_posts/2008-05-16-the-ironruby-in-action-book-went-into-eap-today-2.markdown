It's been a bit of journey but my [IronRuby in Action](http://manning.com/carrero) book finally went into EAP today. EAP means exactly what it means in the software world, still very much subject to change. This could be seen as a public review :)Â  I welcome any suggestions you may have.

You can find the book at [http://manning.com/carrero](http://manning.com/carrero)
There is also a forum there where you can post suggestions and/or problems you may encounter when running the code samples. I look at it as my issue tracker :)

I'm currently working on a chapter where I build a complete twitter client with IronRuby and WPF (not silverlight as indicated on the current TOC). It is based on Witty but uses IronRuby instead of C# to drive the xaml. Also some storyboards have been replaced by IronRuby instead of by xaml stuff. It's also not a straight port of Witty because I haven't really looked at their code apart from the xaml that is.

Happy reading :)

Update: Some people started calling it the "jugs book"
