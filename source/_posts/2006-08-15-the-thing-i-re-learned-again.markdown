I feel so stupid sometimes and today was such a day.. I'd been putting of reinstalling my pc for a  while now.   
I had installed vista on it but my machine just isn't fast enough.


		

The thing I've re-learned today is when installing a pc install the virus scanner last or disable it  during the install period. It shaved about 1 hour of my visual studio installation.


		

All in all I think that feature saves me about 6 hours over the whole install.
