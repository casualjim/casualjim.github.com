Darryl [has tagged me](http://www.geekzone.co.nz/darrylb/1955)

The idea of the tagging bit is that I don't talk about programming but find a couple of things you don't really know about me.

So here we go.

1) I used to be into playing volleyball and soccer (goalie) when i was a lot younger.. and I used to be in a band playing the bass. I obviously wasn't very good in the musical side otherwise i wouldn't be a programmer :)

2) I'm not married nor do I have a relationship at the current time. Not that I'm not interested the last couple relationships just didn't work out.

3) I didn't go to university, but i did start college. I think degrees are highly overrated. Passion, ambition and drive all together is much more important in my book.]

4) I wasn't always a programmer. I've been a bartender/waiter in a studentbar in Antwerp. I've sold timesharing in Spain as an OPC and a sales rep. And in between i've been a junior system engineer for SGS Belgium.

5) When I was at school, I was the one with the big mouth, making jokes all the time and really walking the line of what can and can't be done without getting into too much trouble. I didn't get picked on really but also didn't do much of the picking that goes against my  nature.

So these are my five things i wanted to share today. I guess now it's my time to tag somebody :
