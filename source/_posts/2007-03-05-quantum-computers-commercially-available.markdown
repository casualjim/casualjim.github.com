I personally think this is really big.   


D-Wave Systems is the world's first and only source of quantum
computing for commercial application. We believe quantum technology in
concert with classical, digital processors, can and will represent
broad and significant advancements in the application of computer
science.

In February 2007, D-Wave unveiled and
demonstrated this technology publicly for the first time. The company
plans to deliver field-deployable systems in 2008.
