I finally managed to figure out what the insert key is on my macbook pro. I missed it a lot because in Resharper the standard command to generate code is Alt+Ins. This key combination seems to be engraved in my brain because it was really hard for me to use it with a different key combination. Anyway the winning combinations are: 

_Insert: **fn+return**_

_Alt+Insert: **fn + alt/option + return**_
