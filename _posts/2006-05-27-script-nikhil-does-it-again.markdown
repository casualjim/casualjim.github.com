Nikhil Kothari must be one of my favourite programmers on the whole world. Beside having learned a lot from his blog posts and book. He also develops these great little tools that really help my life as a developer.




This time he wrote a utility called Script# which let's you code normal c# code, not everything is supported yet but in Nikhil I trust ;) and translates it to javascript without all the hassle of writing javascript.




I like the possibilities of javascript a lot but hate the whole scripting experience :)
