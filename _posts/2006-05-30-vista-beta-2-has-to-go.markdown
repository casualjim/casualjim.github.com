The company that hosts one of the servers that I use online is using OpenVPN as their vpn server.




And there are no drivers available voor the enhanced security model of Windows vista.  Yep let's call it enhanced security model instead of f***** security dialog boxes that pop up whenever you want to do something that is not an installed program on your pc.  
I am loving vista absolutely so I'm not uninstalling because I don't think it works. 




I just think that in my case it is too early to make the move untill openvpn has support for vista in their range. Otherwise I can't connect to my online sql server and server which makes my life at lot more stress free but eventually their would be less money coming in :)
