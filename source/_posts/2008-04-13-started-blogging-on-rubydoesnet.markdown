I just put my first post on [http://rubydoes.net](http://rubydoes.net)   
I'm starting a series there on using Silverlight and IronRuby to develop applications. [This post](http://rubydoes.net/2008/04/12/getting-started-with-silverlight-and-ironruby/) is an introduction and announcement of my series on the topic.

I'm porting the [IronPython examples](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/silverlight/index.shtml) from Michael Foord to IronRuby and will do a new example every day of this week.

See you there :)

UPDATE: I didn't make it clear but this blog will still be active. Just most of my IronRuby stuff will go on rubydoes.net
