My ipod headphones died on me.. so it was time to get some new stuff and preferrably better than what I had.

Because I'm a cheap skate and I find it a bit of a ridiculous sight to have these huge headphones on my head when walking down the street.

I went for the [Bose in-ear headphones](http://www.bose.co.nz/site/index.aspx?path=products&CTRL=PG&pfid=10&pgid=109).

And man they are well worth the money.. I can finally get proper bass and the noises from the office/street are drastically pushed to the background.
