I write quite a lot of javascript code these days and have been looking for a couple of months for ways to make my life easier.


		

Easier would mean in my opinion to get some kind of intellisense or autocomplete while writing javascript.


		

As it turns out in visual studio orcas these features will be available so I'll be a very happy vs orcas user i guess :).Â  But in the meantime there is a free eclipse based IDE around aptana that let's you take advantage of autocomplete etc.


		

I added the atlas debug files to the default code profile and I was in business.
