I changed blogs today. My new blog can be found at [http://www.flanders.co.nz/blog](http://www.flanders.co.nz/blog)




Together with the blog I also built a new site.. The only thing that is left to do for me is to migrate the posts from geeks to the new one.  
This blog will allow me to post zip files with projects to go with the posts about coding that I do.




I really love .NET 2.0 everything goes pretty quickly. To build my new site I spent about 14 hours that is for designing, lay-out in masterpages, sql database and content input. The site is bilingual so when dutch people hit my site they get almost everything in dutch and the rest of the world gets it in english.
