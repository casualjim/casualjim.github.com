I was writing an email to a client today explaining them what markdown is and some simple examples. To my surprise outlook understood what I was typing and formatted everything accordingly.

It might be just a subset of markdown, I haven't investigated it deeply,Â but cool anyway.

> For example a bulleted list is   
* item 1  
* item 2  
* item 3
> 
> To put something in bold ***this will be in bold*** and __this will be italic__
