This morning I found an announcement for the [visual studio tools gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.com). I went and had a look they have collected heaps of tools, some free most of them not into a website.

I promptly downloaded a couple of tools. One of them is something I recently discovered I need, local history. That is in between check-ins a file can also change but that isn't recorded in source control so i can't revert or view differences. Turns out that there is a [project on codeplex](http://www.codeplex.com/VLH2005/) that allows you to do just that. It's called local history :)
