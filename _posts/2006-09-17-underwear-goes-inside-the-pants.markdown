On myspace there is a page dedicated to a song [Underwear goes inside the pants by Lazy Boy](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=74874292)

I got to this page via the blog of a friend of mine,[Miel Van Opstal](http://blog.coolz0r.com/2006/09/18/underwear-goes-inside-the-pants/) 

It's worth a listen definitely. An excerpt of the lyrics would be:

_There are homeless people everywhere.  
This homeless guy asked me for money the other day.  
I was about to give it to him and then I thought he was going to use it on drugs or alcohol.  
And then I thought, that’s what I’m going to use it on.  
Why am I judging this poor bastard.  
People love to judge homeless guys. Like if you give them money they’re just going to waste it.  
Well, he lives in a box, what do you want him to do? Save it up and buy a wall unit?_

Enjoy.
