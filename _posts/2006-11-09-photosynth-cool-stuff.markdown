**Welcome to Photosynth**, a new technology from [Microsoft Live Labs](http://labs.live.com/) that takes a large collection of photos of a place or an object, analyzes them for similarities, and displays them in a reconstructed three-dimensional space.

We've assembled a few collections for you to play with, and we're working on adding more. In the future you'll be able to "photosynthesize" your own photos, but we aren't there yet.
