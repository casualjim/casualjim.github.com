Vista is a cool operating system but the fact that I can't run IE6 on it plus the fact that I can't get any of my bluetooth headsets to work with it make it so that I have to roll back to xp for the time being.

 

I can live without IE6 but not without skype :)

 

If somebody knows how to get a logitech or a motorola headset going on vista please let me know. That would mean I can stay on vista :D
