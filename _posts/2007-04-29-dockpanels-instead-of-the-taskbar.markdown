As I said before I really like the concept of [dock panels over the taskbar](http://www.flanders.co.nz/Blog/2007/04/17/WhatIWouldLikeToSeeChangedInVista.aspx) with start menu.

And when I was searching for something on the net I stumbled on this [link to the stardock website](http://www.stardock.com/products/objectdock/). Apparently they have created something like that. It's freeware and above all it's pretty :)

I hope you like it as much as I'm enjoying it.
