    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First off. Maybe you haven't noticed but I switched my blogging engine from Subtext to wordpress. I did this not because I think Subtext is bad. I actually liked it, but because of my host. I was hosting my blog with webhost4life. I get a very very modest amount of people over my blog daily but even that wouldn't work. It doesn't have anything to do with the blogging engine and everything with them. I tried using that server as a stagingserver for an app I built for a client and in the end we staged it from my pc over and adsl line (NZ to Belgium) and that was faster.</p>

<p>I wasn't looking forward to moving blogging engines because I don't want my permalinks to change etc. The whole move was less painful than expected because somebody had already done the work and made a nice write-up. <a href="http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/2007/08/23/breaking-up-moving-blog-engines/">http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/2007/08/23/breaking-up-moving-blog-engines/</a></p>

<p>For the moment I'm running wordpress. Everything seems to work ok and I don't have to restart it 2 or 3 times a day by "changing" my web.config. So in short long live more reliable hosting.</p>
