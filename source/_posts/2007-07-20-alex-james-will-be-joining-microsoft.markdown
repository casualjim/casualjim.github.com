I always thought that if there was one guy in NZ that should be working there it's Alex.

And today he announced that he will be joining Microsoft in September : [http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx?ID=538](http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx?ID=538)

Congratulations Alex. I for one am looking forward to the great things you will be doing there.
