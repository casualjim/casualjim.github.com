Shouldn't be a debate at all. I have a personal preference in languages which goes in this order C#, Ruby, Javascript, Boo/brail,  a bunch of languages i don't know yet, xml + xslt 

Why C# is first on the list is because it comes with visual studio which is IMHO the best IDE out there for the moment. 

VB.NET isn't in the list because I don't see the point in learning another language that is just as powerful as c# but has got a very ugly way for forming syntax. VB doesn't feel logical to me. 

I don't program in a language because of aesthetics but how they flow from my brain onto the keyboard and the purpose of what I'm writing the script for. I tend to think in larger picture concepts languages that support that better have a distinct advantage in my book.  

my 2c.
