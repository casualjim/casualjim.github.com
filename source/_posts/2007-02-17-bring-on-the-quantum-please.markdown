I got [this link](http://www.newwork.com/Pages/Contributors/Shelton/Hammer.html) sent to me recently. I've recently become interested in quantum physics but haven't had the time to start digging deeper into the subject, yet. Anyway if you have some time on your hands you can read the article. I found it quite interesting.

Some interesting passages would be :

> [If the only tool you have is a hammer, you will see every problem as a nail.](http://www.newwork.com/Pages/Contributors/Shelton/Hammer.html)
> 
> According to a recent _Scientific American _article, "a 40-bit quantum computer could re-create in little more than, say, 100 steps, a quantum system that would take a classical computer, having a trillion bits, years to simulate." 

I can't wait until these things become a closer reallity :)
