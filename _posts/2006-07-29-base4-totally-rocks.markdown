The last couple of days I have been playing around with [base4](http://www.base4.net) and I have to tell you if you aren't using it now. You should hurry yourself to their site and start downloading.


		

We are in the process of testing a schema generator that will wrap your existing databases to the base4 schema file.


		

I have a code reduction of at least 33% with another OR/mapper so that counts in my book.


		

Hurry to [base4.net](http://www.base4.net)


		

 


		

People interested in testing the mapper please email me or something.
