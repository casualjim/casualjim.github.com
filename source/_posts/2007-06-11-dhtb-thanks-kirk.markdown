Through [Kirk's blog](http://pageofwords.com/blog/2007/06/06/DHTBILikeComments.aspx)Â I got to a site that allows you to test which type of programmer you are.

Here are my results.

You can take the [test yourself](http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11)

Your programmer personality type is:  
**DHTB**

**You're a Doer.**  
You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money.  
**You like coding at a High level.**  
The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.  
**You work best in a Team.**  
A good group is better than the sum of it's parts. The only thing better than a genius programmer is a cohesive group of genius programmers.  
**You are a liBeral programmer.**  
Programming is a complex task and you should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task. We're not writing on paper anymore so we can take up as much room as we need.
