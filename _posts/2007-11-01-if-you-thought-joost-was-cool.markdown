I have been using Joost for a couple of months now, but today Tony from work put me onto Miro

Some of the things that make Miro somewhat superior are:

  * Play any video file format
  * More HD content than anywhere else
  * 250000 channels as opposed to 250
  * Save you tube videos
  * Miro is an open platform

You can get it at [http://getmiro.com](http://getmiro.com)
