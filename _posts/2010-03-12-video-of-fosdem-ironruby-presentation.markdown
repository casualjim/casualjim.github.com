At FOSDEM 2010 I got the chance to talk in the mono dev room about ironruby.

In this talk I extended the banshee application to work with IronRuby based plugins.

So without further ado here's the link:
[IronRuby: The .NET and Ruby love child](http://andrius.six.lt/~bentkus/videos/mono-fosdem2010/mono-2010-02-07-1000-1100-(Ivan%20Porto%20Carrero)-(The%20Ruby%20and%20the%20.NET%20lovechild).mp4)
