The guys over at [Sapphire Steel](http://sapphiresteel.com) have been doing great work with the current implementation of [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.net/)

 

Today they put a [blog post online](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/IronRuby-and-IntelliSense) showing you how far they got for implementing intellisense.

I'm pretty happy with the progress ironruby is making there are a whole bunch of people contributing. The guys from the Mono team have been following the development as well to make sure you can run ironruby on MS .NET or on Mono which makes it a really good alternative to the C-ruby implementation as soon as Ironruby has matured enough.

 

If you have some free time and are interested in helping some really smart people implementing a programming language I suggest you check out the [ironruby.net website](http://www.ironruby.net/) and [join the](http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/ironruby-core) [mailinglist](http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/ironruby-core) on [rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/projects/ironruby).
